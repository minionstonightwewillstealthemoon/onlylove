        <p>I've been feeling bad for a really long time,
            but without the people in my life I wouldn't be able to cheer up. I made this to personally
            thank everyone without making it too personally and awkward... Just type your discord user (yes.. copy and
            paste)
            and see what I have to say to you!</p>
